## Overview

This repository includes a comprehensive set of experiments that cover fundamental database concepts, SQL commands, and practical implementations within a Library Management System context. Each experiment is designed to enhance understanding of database management and SQL.

## Experiments

1. **Experiment 1**: ER Diagram of Library Management System
2. **Experiment 2**: User Interface (UI) and SQL Commands
3. **Experiment 3**: Data Definition Language (DDL) Commands
4. **Experiment 4**: Database Initialization
5. **Experiment 5**: Data Manipulation Language (DML) Commands
6. **Experiment 6**: Built-in Functions
7. **Experiment 7**: Aggregate Functions
8. **Experiment 8**: ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING Clause
9. **Experiment 9**: Set Operators, Nested Queries, and Joins
10. **Experiment 10**: SQL Transaction Control Language (TCL) Commands
11. **Experiment 11**: SQL Data Control Language (DCL) Commands
12. **Experiment 12**: Creation of Views and Assertions

Each experiment contains code snippets, explanations, and outcomes that illustrate the principles of database management systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite (specify which you used)
- **Programming Language**: SQL
- **Tools**: [Any additional tools or frameworks you used, e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin]
